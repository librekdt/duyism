			<h2 id="is-ok"> It is ok to non-duyist if you: </h2>
			<ol type="I">
				<li> Never Criticize Duy, Amethyst, and devs </li>
				<li> Never used Mcinalagsimulatorsandbox.apk and lagboatboardwalkclone.apk </li>
				<li> Never listened to bhai tutorials </li>
				<li> Never used NFA or Unholy methods which Dayum says</li>
				<li> Believe that Duyism is a valid way of life </li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Duyism might be friendly to non-duyists if they recognise duy as good person/creature.<br>
				But ofc only duyists will have PojavHeavenVersion.apk and PojavHeavenVersion.ipa in the afterlife

			<h2 id="duy"> Duy </h2>
			<p> created the universe, henceforth duy by extension has created everything. </p>






			<h2 id="bhaint"> The Bhain't </h2>
			<h3> The origin of Pirata Stupid√¶ Bhaia </h3>
			<p>
				the bh√¶ (also known as bhais) are species of Pirata Stupid√¶.<br>
				The commonly used indian word by bhais became synonymous with bh√¶.<br>
				These species were thought that they became extinct during end of 19th or start 20th century,<br>
				then, not so long after duyy Duye's reapperance, it was shown that truth is contrary.<br>
				To this day "Pirata Stupid√¶ bhaia" remain as most dominant Pirata subdivision.<br>
				That means term bhai/bh√¶/bhaia meaning ‚Äústupid pirate‚Äù became expectation,<br>
				thenceforth I will call these just bhai or bh√¶, for simplification.
			</p>
			
			<h3> So what are bh√¶? </h3>
			<p>
				Since emergement of bh√¶ from pure stupidity,<br>
				selected behaviours seemed to became bh√¶ normality.<br>
				So for example bhai would, in holy duylands especially,<br>
				scream about lag, heat, support, cringe or similiar insanity.<br>
				Since bh√¶ belong to Pirata (stupid√¶) species family,<br>
				supermajority of bh√¶ also like to do piracy.
			</p>
			<h3> How to prevent bh√¶? </h3>
			<p>
				Hell of duyism is the answer expectation,<br>
				hence all bh√¶ are left with no immidiate solution.<br>
				Hence we should punish them to prevent this?<br>
				Howerer act of that would result in crisis,<br>
				hence better solution is to try teach them ways of duyism,<br>
				henceforth we should not kill on sight anyone commiting bhaism,<br>
				howerer we should commit to them life long duyism checking,<br>
				hence they will not be piracy doing.
				They are been corrupted by Dayum.
			</p>
			<h3> Etc </h3>
			<p>
				Estimates show that there is extra stupid bh√¶ population percentange.<br>
				Exterminate these on sight of their's garbage.<br>
				Examples of such behaviour are nfa, sfa and scamming,<br>
				end quickly theirs attempt at bhaism enlarging.
			</p>
			<h3> Note </h3>
